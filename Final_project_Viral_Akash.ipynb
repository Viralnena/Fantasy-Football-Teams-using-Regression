    "### INTRODUCTION:\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### AIM : The aim of this project is to build a model capable of predicting high performing fantasy football teams\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Github Repo: https://github.com/JoshuaPlacidi/Fantasy-Football-Team-Predictions.git\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### DESCRIPTION OF PAPER: \n",
    "The paper presents a hybrid methodology combining ARIMA and RNN models to predict football player points in Fantasy Premier League, optimizing player selection through Linear Programming. The approach, validated in the ongoing season, demonstrates effective performance prediction and potential for use by official on-field managers in the English Premier League.\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### PROBLEM STATEMENT : \n",
    "* Trying to replicate the process of the time series models explained in the research paper.\n",
    "* chose the respective available dataset. (Dataset was scaraped from the official FPL API and mergered into a single file)\n",
    "* Link for dataset before merging into single csv file :- https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League/\n",
    "* The performance of football players is predicted using regularised regression-based machine learning algorithms, which are then compared.\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM:\n",
    "*  The challenge of optimizing player selection in Fantasy Premier League due to varying player performance across seasons, proposing a hybrid ARIMA-RNN model and Linear Programming to predict and maximize player points in the simulated environment.\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### SOLUTION:\n",
    "* The study aims to develop a predictive system for high-performing fantasy football teams using FPL data.\n",
    "* This task will be accomplished through linear regression, linear optimization, Arima-Rnn model. \n"

    "During the implementations of this project, i learnt how to replicate the research paper using the github repo. Here i have learnt how how to reduce the chances of overfitting the model. Undestanding the importance of features in predicting performance. For evaluating the model use of metrics such as mean error. experimenting with the features, parameter on models to improve accuracy of the model. \n",

    "#### Results Discussion :\n",
    "\n",
    "Two modelsâ€”Linear Regression and Ridge Regressionâ€”were used in this project's outcomes, and their outcomes were compared. The performance of both models was assessed using the mean error score after they were applied to a dataset, specifically the players dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was clear from the results that both models behaved very similarly, producing similar mean error ratings. This implies that the target variable on this dataset was successfully predicted using both linear regression and ridge regression. Their different approaches to handling the correlation between characteristics and the goal variable may be responsible for the slight variation in their performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting was a problem, and balanced training and testing data helped. The model generalization and feature significance of Ridge Regression were noticed. Future plans call for the use of bigger datasets and more sophisticated algorithms. The performance of the models, the author's learning, limitations, and future directions are highlighted in the discussion. the discussion of results emphasizes the comparable performance of Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models on the given dataset. The project served as a platform for the author to learn, experiment, and draw insights into the intricacies of model implementation and evaluation. While highlighting limitations and potential extensions, the author's understanding of the underlying concepts and their practical implications is evident. \n",
    "#### Limitations :\n",
    "* Over fitting of model can be real challenge , so balancing training testing can help in generalizing the unseen data.  \n",
    "* These model shrinks coefficients towards zero, potentially keeping less important features in the model.\n",
    "*******************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Future Extension :\n",
    "* To improve the accuracy of the model we implement the model on a larger data set. \n",
    "* for predections the algorithms can be implemented with some advance model."
